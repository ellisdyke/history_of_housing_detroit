    <h1>Mapping Detroit's Housing Inequities</h1>
    <p><strong>By: Atika Nusrat, Ellis Dyke, Christy Choi</strong></p>

    <div class="section">
        <p>
            Detroit‚Äôs housing landscape tells a story of opportunity systematically denied. Over the past century, 
            discriminatory practices such as redlining, racially restrictive covenants, and urban renewal programs 
            have shaped who could build wealth‚Äîand who could not. Even today, the lasting imprint of these policies 
            remains visible across the city‚Äôs neighborhoods.
        </p>
        <p>
            Drawing from census data, public property records, and historical maps, this project visualizes how structural 
            racism fractured Detroit‚Äôs housing market. Inspired by the <em>Harms Report</em> produced for the Detroit Reparations 
            Task Force by researchers at the University of Michigan, we explore six key facets of Detroit's ongoing housing inequities.

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Shifting Demographics: White Flight and Black Growth</h2>
        <p>
            In the mid-20th century, federal redlining practices and racial violence drove white residents to the suburbs while 
            concentrating Black residents in disinvested urban cores. Using census data from 1940 to 2020, our 
            <a class="button-link" href="https://historyofhousingdetroit-5tkze2tbbpgkp6yppvntwc.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">üîó Population Trends Visualizer</a> 
            traces these dramatic demographic shifts between Detroit and its surrounding suburbs.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>The Hardening of Segregation</h2>
        <p>
            As white residents left Detroit, surrounding suburbs like Dearborn and Grosse Pointe maintained exclusionary policies 
            to block Black migration. Our 
            <a class="button-link" href="https://historyofhousingdetroit-5tkze2tbbpgkp6yppvntwc.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">üîó Racial Proportions Visualizer</a> 
            illustrates how racial divides between Detroit and its suburbs widened over time, revealing how segregation was 
            deliberately reinforced through both public and private means.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Homeownership Gaps: Progress or Illusion?</h2>
        <p>
            Although Black homeownership in Detroit increased after white flight, this "gain" occurred within a hollowed-out city 
            plagued by disinvestment and declining property values. Our 
            <a class="button-link" href="https://historyofhousingdetroit-5tkze2tbbpgkp6yppvntwc.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">üîó Homeownership Visualizer</a> 
            compares ownership rates across racial groups, revealing that true wealth-building opportunities remained unequal.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>The Racial Wealth Gap in Property Values</h2>
        <p>
            Redlining, urban renewal, and predatory real estate practices depressed property values in majority-Black neighborhoods, 
            creating a persistent racial wealth gap. Our 
            <a class="button-link" href="https://historyofhousingdetroit-5tkze2tbbpgkp6yppvntwc.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">üîó Home Values Visualizer</a> 
            shows how neighborhoods with higher Black populations saw far slower growth in home values compared to whiter areas.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Redlining‚Äôs Enduring Legacy</h2>
        <p>
            The federal Home Owners‚Äô Loan Corporation (HOLC) maps classified Black neighborhoods as ‚Äúhazardous,‚Äù cutting them off 
            from loans and insurance for decades. In our project, HOLC boundaries are overlaid directly onto Detroit‚Äôs housing data, 
            revealing the deep connections between 20th-century policy and present-day inequality.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Foreclosure, Recovery, and Racial Repair</h2>
        <p>
            After the 2008 housing crash, mass tax foreclosures devastated Detroit‚Äôs Black communities once again. The Detroit Land 
            Bank Authority (DLBA) was established to manage vacant properties and resell them to new owners. Our 
            <a class="button-link" href="https://historyofhousingdetroit-2kdjxr2appzvpx8y349aqmf.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">üîó DLBA Re-Occupancy and HOLC Overlay Visualizer</a> 
            maps DLBA sales and re-occupancy efforts against historic redlining grades‚Äîhighlighting the ongoing challenges of 
            reversing decades of systemic disinvestment.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Conclusion: Repairing a Broken System</h2>
        <p>
            These interactive visualizations collectively demonstrate how public policies engineered Detroit‚Äôs racial segregation 
            and economic inequity‚Äîand why today's repair efforts must confront that history directly. True equity requires 
            not only recognizing these patterns, but building systems that dismantle them.
