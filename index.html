  <h1>History of Housing and Racism in Detroit</h1>

  <p>
    For over a century, housing in Detroit has reflected deeply entrenched racial and economic divides.
    This project explores how discriminatory policies like redlining, urban renewal, and restrictive covenants
    shaped who was allowed to live where — and how those patterns persist today. Through interactive data
    visualizations, we track changes in land use and property ownership that mirror larger patterns of segregation
    and inequity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our explorable visualizer focuses on properties sold through the Detroit Land Bank Authority (DLBA) from 2014–2024.
    We show how many of these properties remain unoccupied, while others achieve re-occupancy through Certificates of
    Occupancy. The animated map below helps illustrate both progress and ongoing challenges in reversing decades of disinvestment.
  </p>

  <h2>Explore the Data</h2>
  <p>
    Use the animation slider or “Play” button to scroll through property activity year by year.
    Gray dots show properties still owned by DLBA, orange dots represent DLBA sales, and green dots mark parcels
    that became re-occupied. Together, these layers visualize the slow rebuilding of Detroit’s neighborhoods — and
    the gaps that remain.
