    <h1>History of Housing and Racism in Detroit</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p>For over a century, housing in Detroit has reflected deeply entrenched racial and economic divides. This project explores how discriminatory policies like redlining, urban renewal, and restrictive covenants shaped who was allowed to live where — and how those patterns persist today. Through interactive data visualizations, we track changes in land use and property ownership that mirror larger patterns of segregation and inequity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Our explorable visualizer dives into four key aspects of Detroit's housing history:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Population Trends Over Time by Race and Location:</strong> This interactive visualization allows you to explore demographic changes in Detroit and its suburbs from 1940 to 2020. By examining the shifts in Black and White populations, you can see how racial dynamics within and outside the city have evolved.</li>
            <li><strong>Proportion of Black and White Populations Over Time by Location:</strong> Engage with the data on a comparative level, observing how the proportions of racial groups have changed over time in both the city and its suburbs. This visualization provides insights into the ongoing racial composition of the area.</li>
            <li><strong>Demographics and Homeownership Rates by Race in Detroit:</strong> Delve into the historical disparities in homeownership rates between Black and White communities. By toggling between races and analyzing the data over time, you can uncover the persistent inequalities in property ownership.</li>
            <li><strong>Detroit Land Bank Authority (DLBA) Sales and Re-Occupancy:</strong> Discover our animated map of properties sold through the Detroit Land Bank Authority from 2014–2024. It highlights which properties remain unoccupied and which have achieved re-occupancy through Certificates of Occupancy, illustrating both progress and ongoing challenges in reversing decades of disinvestment.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Interactive Visual: Re-Occupancy of DLBA Properties</h2>
        <p>This interactive visual shows how Detroit's buy-back and sales programs have impacted re-occupancy rates over the past decade. It features an animated timeline map of Detroit Land Bank Authority (DLBA) properties sold between 2014 and 2024. The map shows which properties were sold, which remain vacant, and which achieved re-occupancy through Certificates of Occupancy. It highlights both the progress made and challenges that remain in reversing decades of disinvestment in Detroit’s housing stock.</p>
