    <h1>Mapping Detroit's Housing Inequities</h1>
    <p><strong>By: Atika Nusrat, Ellis Dyke, Christy Choi</strong></p>

    <div class="section">
        <p>
            For over a century, Detroit's housing landscape has reflected America's most entrenched racial and economic divides. 
            Inspired by research from the Harms Report for the Detroit Reparations Task Force published by the University of Michigan, 
            this project reveals how discriminatory policies systematically shaped the city's neighborhoods. We examine how redlining, 
            urban renewal, and restrictive covenants â€” all meticulously documented in the report â€” created lasting patterns of segregation 
            and wealth inequality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each visualization builds upon the report's documentation of:
            <ul>
                <li>Population shifts following racist housing policies (p. 7-9)</li>
                <li>Home value disparities tied to redlining (p. 4, 7-8)</li>
                <li>The disproportionate impact of urban renewal on Black communities (p. 14-15)</li>
            </ul>
            By combining the report's historical analysis with publicly available data, including census data, 
            we reveal how racism continues to influence who can build wealth through homeownership in Detroit today. 
            Our interactive visualizer explores six pillars of Detroitâ€™s housing inequity:

        <h2>1. Population Trends Over Time by Race and Location</h2>
        <p>
            This visualization tracks demographic shifts in Detroit and its suburbs from 1940 to 2020. 
            The data reveals the stark consequences of white flight, accelerated by federal redlining, 
            racially restrictive covenants, and violent resistance to integration.

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Proportion of Black and White Populations Over Time by Location</h2>
        <p>
            Compare racial proportions in Detroit versus its suburbs to see how segregation hardened over the 20th century. 
            In 1940, Detroit was 90% white; by 2010, it was 83% Black. 
            Meanwhile, suburbs like Dearborn and Grosse Pointe remained overwhelmingly white due to exclusionary policies.

        <h2>3. Demographics and Homeownership by Race in Detroit</h2>
        <p>
            This dual-axis visualization exposes Detroitâ€™s population collapse and reveals stark disparities in homeownership.
            Black residents now make up a majority of Detroitâ€™s population, but systemic barriers to ownership persist.

        <h2>4. Trends in Median Home Values by Black Population</h2>
        <p>
            This graph illustrates how redlining and urban renewal devastated property values in Black neighborhoods, 
            leaving a legacy of racial wealth gaps that persist today.

        <h2>5. HOLC Grades in Detroit, MI</h2>
        <p>
            The federal Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) graded neighborhoods by "risk," 
            systematically designating Black areas as hazardous, cutting them off from loans and investment.

        <h2>6. DLBA Sales, Re-Occupancy, and Redlining (2014â€“2024)</h2>
        <p>
            This animated map tracks properties sold by the Detroit Land Bank Authority (DLBA) after the foreclosure crisis, 
            illustrating Detroitâ€™s uneven recovery and continuing struggles to rebuild neighborhoods.

        <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
        <p>
            These visuals collectively show how racist policies engineered segregation, extracted Black wealth, 
            and left Detroitâ€™s housing system fractured. Repair demands systemic change rooted in this history.
