st.title("History of Redlining and Housing Inequality in Detroit")

# Introduction text
st.markdown("""
For over a century, housing in Detroit has reflected deeply entrenched racial and economic divides.
This project explores how discriminatory policies like redlining, urban renewal, and restrictive covenants
shaped who was allowed to live where â€” and how those patterns persist today. 
Through interactive data visualizations, we track changes in land use and property ownership
that mirror larger patterns of segregation and inequity.
